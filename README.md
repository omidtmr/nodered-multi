# Multi-Instance Node-RED Launcher

---

## 🧾 Project Background

This launcher setup is built on top of  
[TotallyInformation’s alternate-node-red-installer](https://github.com/TotallyInformation/alternate-node-red-installer).

That project provides a local, flexible Node-RED installer without needing global packages or elevated permissions.

### 🔧 Additions in This Project

This fork adds:
- Cross-platform support with `start-all.command` (macOS) and `start-all.bat` (Windows)
- Automated generation of 10 independent Node-RED instances
- A user-friendly launcher experience via double-click files
- Simplified structure for easy distribution or classroom use


This project allows you to run **10 isolated instances** of Node-RED on a single computer, each with its own port and configuration. It's fully cross-platform and portable — works on **macOS and Windows**.

Each instance:
- Runs independently (ports 1880 to 1889)
- Has its own `userDir` and flow file
- Can be launched via double-click (no terminal knowledge needed)

---

## 🚀 How to Use

### macOS

1. **Double-click** `start-all.command`
2. It will launch all 10 instances in the background
3. Open your browser and go to:
   - http://localhost:1880
   - http://localhost:1881  
   - ...
   - http://localhost:1889

> ⚠️ Requires [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) installed

---

### Windows

1. **Double-click** `start-all.bat`
2. Ten Command Prompt windows will open (one per instance)
3. Access the dashboards in your browser:
   - http://localhost:1880
   - ...
   - http://localhost:1889
